## Currently working on

- For the jump i think ill need to just create a isOnGround function
  and then move directly in the main class the player for the size ?
  idk ill try (for now the player is teleporting all the way up and doesn't want to use a smoother animation :(  )

## Bug fixes

## Terrain
* Create a terrain
	* Create the platforms, from heritage of terrain's class
	* Create a terrain generator
	* Create a terrain renderer

## General
	- Use textures instead of colors (petit type :)
	- Change the magic number to const - radius in player.hpp, variable groundY
